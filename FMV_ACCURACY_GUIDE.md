# Fair Market Value (FMV) Accuracy Guide

## Overview
The Enhanced FMV Assistant provides SARS-compliant Fair Market Value calculations with professional-grade accuracy and comprehensive documentation for audit protection.

## üéØ Key Accuracy Improvements

### 1. **Multi-Source Price Research**
- Opens searches in 6 major SA retailers simultaneously
- Takealot, Makro, Game, Incredible Connection, Hirsch's, PriceCheck
- Users can manually verify and enter exact prices found
- Each price source is timestamped for accuracy

### 2. **Manual Price Entry System**
**Purpose**: Ensures 100% accurate pricing from actual retailer websites

**Features**:
- Add unlimited price sources manually
- Enter retailer name, exact price, and product URL
- Edit or remove any price source
- Track which prices are manually verified vs estimated

**How It Works**:
1. User clicks "Open Search in All SA Retailers"
2. System opens search tabs for all 6 retailers
3. User finds exact product and notes the price
4. User clicks "Add Price" button
5. Enters: Retailer name, exact price, product URL
6. Price is added to comparison list with verification

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**
**Three Calculation Methods**:

**Average FMV** (Most Common):
- Sum of all prices √∑ number of sources
- Best when prices are consistent
- Recommended by SARS for multiple similar sources

**Median FMV** (Conservative):
- Middle value when prices are sorted
- Eliminates outlier impact
- Better when one price is significantly different
- SARS accepts median for high variance scenarios

**Custom Selection**:
- User can select any individual source price
- Useful when one retailer is clearly most relevant
- Must document reasoning in notes

**Price Variance Analysis**:
- Automatic calculation: (Max - Min) / Average √ó 100
- Green: <15% variance (excellent consistency)
- Yellow: 15-30% variance (acceptable range)
- Red: >30% variance (requires attention)

### 4. **Validation & Verification System**

**Automatic Validation Checks**:
```
‚úì Minimum 3 price sources recommended
‚úì Price variance under 30% for auto-verification
‚úì Proof documentation attached
‚úì Calculation method matches price sources
‚úì Notes explain any special circumstances
```

**Verification Status**:
- **Verified**: ‚â•3 sources, <30% variance, proof attached
- **Requires Review**: <3 sources or >30% variance
- Stored in database for audit trail

**Smart Warnings**:
- "Add at least 3 price sources for better accuracy"
- "High price variance (X%) - verify sources"
- "Consider adding screenshot URLs as proof"
- Must be addressed before finalizing

### 5. **Proof Documentation System**

**Multiple Proof Types**:
1. **Product URLs**: Direct links to retailer pages
2. **Screenshot URLs**: Links to stored images (Google Drive, Dropbox)
3. **Price Comparison Sites**: PriceCheck, MyBroadband forums
4. **Manufacturer RRP**: Official recommended retail price

**Documentation Best Practices**:
- Screenshot each retailer page showing price
- Upload to cloud storage (Google Drive/Dropbox)
- Copy shareable link to FMV Assistant
- Add notes about item condition (new/sealed/used)
- Include date of valuation

**SARS Audit Protection**:
All proof is stored with:
- Valuation date
- Retailer names
- Product links
- Screenshot URLs
- Calculation methodology
- User notes

### 6. **Enhanced Calculation Methods**

**Retailer Price (Default)**:
- For new items in original packaging
- Uses current retail prices from major chains
- Most defensible to SARS
- Requires documentation from reputable retailers

**Market Research**:
- For items not widely available
- Combines multiple source types
- May include forums, classifieds
- Requires detailed documentation

**Comparable Sales**:
- For used or second-hand items
- Based on recent actual sales
- Check Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree
- Must document comparable condition

## üìä FMV Calculation Workflow

### Step 1: Item Description
```
Input: "iPhone 15 Pro 256GB Black"
‚úì Specific model number
‚úì Storage capacity
‚úì Color variant
‚úì Condition (new/sealed)
```

### Step 2: Multi-Retailer Search
```
System opens 6 tabs:
1. Takealot search
2. Makro search
3. Game search
4. Incredible Connection search
5. Hirsch's search
6. PriceCheck search
```

### Step 3: Price Collection
```
User finds prices and adds manually:

Source 1: Takealot - R21,999 (link)
Source 2: Makro - R22,499 (link)
Source 3: Incredible Connection - R21,899 (link)
Source 4: Game - R22,199 (link)

Average: R22,149
Median: R22,099
Variance: 2.7% ‚úì Good consistency
```

### Step 4: Select FMV Method
```
Option A: Use Average (R22,149)
Option B: Use Median (R22,099)
Option C: Select specific source

Recommendation shown based on variance:
"Good price consistency! Average or median appropriate."
```

### Step 5: Add Proof
```
Add screenshots/links:
- Takealot product page screenshot
- Makro product page screenshot
- PriceCheck comparison page
- Date: 2025-10-26
```

### Step 6: Validation
```
‚úì 4 price sources (minimum met)
‚úì 2.7% variance (excellent)
‚úì 3 proof URLs attached
‚úì Item description specific

Status: VERIFIED
Ready for SARS compliance
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SARS Compliance Features

### What SARS Requires:
1. **Fair Market Value Definition**:
   - Price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller
   - In an open market
   - At arm's length
   - Neither under compulsion

2. **Acceptable Evidence**:
   - Retail prices from reputable merchants
   - Recent transaction prices
   - Professional valuations
   - Price comparison sites

3. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Date of valuation
   - Method used
   - Sources consulted
   - Price range if multiple sources
   - Reasoning for final value selected

### How FMV Assistant Meets Requirements:

**‚úì Open Market Prices**: 6 major SA retailers
**‚úì Multiple Sources**: Encourages 3+ sources

## üîç Audit Defense Strategy

If SARS questions your FMV:

1. **Show Multiple Sources**: "I got prices from 4 major retailers"
2. **Show Documentation**: "Here are screenshots from each"
3. **Explain Method**: "I used the median of 4 current retail prices"
4. **Show Variance**: "Prices ranged from X to Y, only 5% variance"
5. **Show Date**: "All prices from the same week I received item"
6. **Show Reasoning**: "Conservative estimate, used median not highest"

## üìä Statistical Validity

**Why 3+ Sources?**:
- Single source: No comparison
- Two sources: Could be outliers
- Three+ sources: Statistical validity
- Five+ sources: High confidence

**Why Median vs Average?**:
- Average: Best for consistent prices
- Median: Better with outliers
- SARS accepts both with justification

**Variance Thresholds**:
- 0-15%: Excellent (normal retail variance)
- 15-30%: Acceptable (different retailers/promotions)
- 30%+: High (requires explanation/investigation)

## üéØ Conclusion

The Enhanced FMV Assistant ensures SARS-compliant valuations through:
- ‚úÖ Multiple price source verification
- ‚úÖ Statistical calculation methods
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive proof documentation
- ‚úÖ Automatic validation checks
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail
